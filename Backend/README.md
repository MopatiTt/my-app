-it includes input fields for email, username, phone no, password and a submit button. It also include a link to the login page.
-Uses React Hooks to manage the form state. Each input field has its own state, values updated as the user types into input fields.
-The handleSubmit function is called when the user submits the form, which logs the form data to the console and resets the form fields.
-Uses useNavigate hook to navigate to the login page when the "Login" link is clicked.
